> A package for producing and consuming Kafka messages

This folder contains a package that facilitates producing and consuming Kafka
messages. It contains two data objects(with child objects) together with
serializer and deserializer. The package is used by Zeebe to produce data about
processes and process instances. The package is used by the Batch Controller to
consume that information.
